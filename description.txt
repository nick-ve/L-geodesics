Geodesics
=========
Following the formalism of Special and General Relativity in terms  
of 4-vectors and metrics, a method is developed to derive the equations of motion  
for test bodies.  
This is achieved by applying the principle of least action for a certain path integral.  
The case of Classical Mechanics using the Hamilton-Lagrange variational principle  
is reviewed and a link is made with the separation of events in space-time.  
The actual worldline followed by a test body is called a geodesic and it is that  
worldline for which the separation is an extremum.  
Via this approach a relativistic equivalent of the Lagrange equations is obtained  
which leads to the geodesic equation, which allows the determination of  
the actual worldline which will be followed by a test body.
